    <h1> Goodmorning, my little blueberry muffin!</h1>
    <p> I'm taking a break from coding and doing my class stuff so I'm making this website
        just for fun. I'll likely send it to you once I'm done. haha it's just
        something simple to say that I'm thinking of you! I think the file is corrupt for the image
        I am trying to add so it might not show up. However, since it's 6am and I still havent gone to sleep,
        I am not going to fuss with it any longer lol Drive safe today. I love you! </p>
